# Toasts (Flash Messages)

Toasts are the flash messages that appear at the top-right side of the screen when an action is performed. They are used to give the user feedback on the result of their action.

----

### Rules

- Only use full stops `.` at the end of a flash message if it contains multiple sentences
- Try to stick with the basic formula unless you need to deviate to communicate something more complex

----

## Basic Formula

### Success

**The formula:**

```
Successfully VERB the OBJECT'S NAME OBJECT
Successfully VERB the OBJECT'S NAME OBJECT as/to STATE
```

**Example:**

```

Successfully marked the Example Name programme as complete
Successfully added the Example Name startup to the event

Successfully unsubscribed Joe Bloggs's account
```

### Danger

**The formula:**

```

Something went wrong VERB the OBJECT'S NAME OBJECT as/to RESULT. Please try again.

Something went wrong VERB OBJECT_NAME. Please try again.
Something went wrong VERB the OBJECT_NAME to/from the OBJECT2_NAME'S OBJECT2. Please try again.
